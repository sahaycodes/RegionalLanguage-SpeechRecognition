# RegionalLanguage-SpeechRecognition
<div align='center'>

<h1>A Deep-Learning Project focusing on the reception of Regional Language Text converted from the derived Regional Language Speech </h1>
<p>This project deals with the idea of Regional Speech Language Recognition mainly focusing on - Hindi + its different dialects and accents present in the Community </p>

### :space_invader: Tech Stack


### :dart: Features
- Recognising Hindi Language with different accents + the diverse dialects we have in it , Currently recognizing (Hindi - Odia Language)
- Recognising the subtle differences in the male and female voice while speaking Hindi (Results  - Male Biased more while Recognizing Sppech)
- Using HuggingFace and  Wav2Vec2Processor
- Using Deep Learning techniques for Speech Recognition

## :compass: Roadmap

* [x] Odia Hindi Language Speech is Recognized by the Software
* [ ] Collecting in more Data (Dialects + Accents ) for Training and Testing
* [ ] Using diverse deep learning models to boost up the accuracy
